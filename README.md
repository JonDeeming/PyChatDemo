Basic Python Chatroom Demonstration
===================

A simple chat application that demonstrates how to structure a Flask-SocketIO application.
Shamelessly derived from Miguel Grinberg's original code (https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/Flask-SocketIO-Chat)

To run this application install the requirements in a virtual environment, then run:

    $ python chat.py

Visit `http://localhost:8080` on one or more browser tabs.

The main changes from the original code are:
1. Changed the default port to 8080
2. Added styling of the HTML with Bootstrap, so it's a little prettier for demonstrations.
